COEN 379 Winter 2021 Homework 3 Problem 3
Shiva Govindaraju
Using Python 3 to run simulation to complete homework-problem.
--Write a program to
---generate a set S of N = 100 random nonnegative integers less than P = 1000003 (a prime); and then
---generate for set S a random perfect universal hash function h(x) = ((ax + b) mod P)mod N^2, where 0 < a < P  and  0 â‰¤ b < P.
--How many tries did it take on average?
SOLUTION:
- On one attempt where I ran 100 simulations, the average number of tries was 1.73
- On another attempt w/ 100 sims, it was 1.7
- On a third attempt w/ 100 sims, it was 1.59
- When attempting w/ 50 sims, it was 1.84
- When attempting w/ 25 sims, it was 1.48
- When attempting w/ 10 sims, it was 1.5
- When attempting w/ 1000 sims, it was 1.616
